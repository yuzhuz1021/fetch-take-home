# fetch-take-home

This repository contains my solution for the Fetch coding exercise. The exercise involved analyzing data on users, brands, and receipts, designing a relational data model, writing SQL queries to answer business questions, identifying data quality issues, and communicating findings to stakeholders.

## [Project Overview](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/analytics-engineer/ineeddata-data-modeling/data-modeling.html)

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate data reasoning, modeling, querying, and communication skills. I was provided with three JSON datasets (users, brands, receipts) in a compressed format and tasked with:

1.  **Data Modeling:** Design a structured relational data model from the unstructured JSON data.
2.  **SQL Querying:** Write SQL queries to answer specific business questions.
3.  **Data Quality Analysis:** Identify and document data quality issues.
4.  **Stakeholder Communication:** Communicate findings and questions to a non-technical stakeholder.
